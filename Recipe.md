Step 1. Fill a pot with water and put it to boil.

Step 2. Once boiled, add the ramen noodles to the water and let them cook. 

Step 3. Remove the noodles from the water using a strainer. Keep a little bit of water. 

Step 4. Add the soup sauce and powder found in the packet. 

Step 5. Mix the sauce and powder until all the noodles are well covered. 

Step 6. Take one egg and fry it over medium style. This means the yolk should not be hard nor too soft. The yolk should be slightly runny.

Step 7. Add the egg to the noodles. If you want the noodles more creamy, you can choose to mix the egg in. 

Step 8. Enjoy!
